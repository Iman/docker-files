DockerFiles
===========

A dockerfile for hosting Nominatim, where the postgres database is on an EBS

### Usage

Create a `config.sh` with the appropriate variables, use `config.sh.template` as a starter. Important to fillout the `websiteurl`, `originaluid`, and `originalgid`

Discover where your EBS mount is: `sudo fdisk -l` Suppose it is at `/dev/xvdb`

Mount the EBS: `mkdir -p /opt/disk/; sudo mount /dev/xvdb /opt/disk/`

Run the Docker
```
$docker run --name="nominatim" -p 80:80 -v /home/ec2-user/config.sh:/app/config.sh -v /opt/disk:/app/disk/ -it -d maluuba/nominatim
```

## Building

To build the image, simply invoke

    docker build github.com/Maluuba/docker-files/tree/master/docker-nominatim

A prebuilt container is also available in the docker index

    docker pull maluuba/nominatim

## After Build

If you have issues after building with utf-8 in functions, run:
```
sudo -u postgres -- /app/nominatim/utils/setup.php --create-functions --enable-diff-updates
# Reload postgres assume the new config
service postgresql restart
```
